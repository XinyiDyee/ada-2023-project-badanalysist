                    <p>
                        Our matched dataset, featuring 6,084 breweries and 45,640 beers from BeerAdvocate and RateBeer,
                        includes over 1.2 million ratings.
                        A 20-rating threshold refines this extensive dataset, optimizing processing speed and focusing
                        on frequently reviewed beers.
                        The matched data from both platforms ensures cross-platform consistency, enhancing our model's
                        reliability and quality,
                        making it ideal for developing a beer recommendation system.

                    <h4>Distribution comparison of rating features between two websites</h4>
                    <p>
                        The histogram charts presented appear to compare the distribution of beer ratings between two
                        websites: RateBeer and BeerAdvocate.
                        The data has been cleaned to remove all NaN values and then standardized using min-max scaling
                        to ensure comparability across different rating scales.
                        The histograms are divided into five categories: alcohol by volume (abv), appearance, aroma,
                        palate, and taste.
                        From a visual analysis, we can see that the general trends between RateBeer and BeerAdvocate are
                        similar,
                        suggesting a level of agreement in the ratings of the matched data provided by users on both
                        platforms.
                        The most notable patterns are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>ABV:</b> The distribution for ABV appears to be left-skewed for both RateBeer and
                            BeerAdvocate, indicating that most beers have a lower alcohol content.</li>
                        <li><b>Appearance:</b> Both sites show a high frequency of beers with higher appearance ratings,
                            with a sharp peak at the high end of the scale.</li>
                        <li><b>Aroma:</b> The distributions for aroma ratings are quite similar between the two sites,
                            with a slight right skew, suggesting that users generally rate the aroma of beers
                            positively.</li>
                        <li><b>Palate:</b> The palate ratings show a more varied distribution, with RateBeer displaying
                            a bimodal distribution, suggesting two common ratings at which beers are evaluated, whereas
                            BeerAdvocate's distribution is more right-skewed.</li>
                        <li><b>Taste:</b> Taste ratings are crucial, and here both sites show a right-skewed
                            distribution, indicating a tendency towards higher ratings for taste.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div id="rate-dist" class="plotly-chart"></div>
                    <div class="spacing"></div>

                    <h4>Beer feature and score correlations of the two websites</h4>
                    <p>For RateBeer:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is a moderate to strong positive correlation between taste and aroma, which is the
                            highest correlation observed (0.74).</li>
                        <li>Appearance has a moderate positive correlation with palate (0.44) and taste (0.40).</li>
                        <li>ABV has the lowest correlations with other features, suggesting that the alcohol content
                            does not strongly influence how users rate the other attributes of the beer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For BeerAdvocate:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The correlations are generally higher compared to RateBeer, indicating a stronger
                            relationship between the features on this platform.</li>
                        <li>Taste and aroma again have a strong positive correlation (0.76), which is consistent with
                            RateBeer's ratings.</li>
                        <li>Appearance has a strong correlation with both palate (0.56) and taste (0.52), which is
                            somewhat stronger than on RateBeer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Overall, this heatmap suggests that certain attributes of beer, such as taste and aroma,
                        are consistently perceived as related by users of both RateBeer and BeerAdvocate.
                        The strength of the correlations varies slightly between the two platforms, but the general
                        pattern remains the same,
                        indicating similar rating behaviors among the users.
                        This information can be particularly useful for brewers and marketers to understand what
                        characteristics of beer are
                        most influential in consumer ratings and perception.

                    <h4>Percentages about beer styles</h4>
                    <p>
                        The pie chart visualizes the popularity of various beer styles within our dataset, which
                        includes 104 different styles. The pie chart lists first twelve beer styles which take up most
                        of percentage in the dataset.
                        "American IPA" is the most popular listed style, making up 12.1% of the dataset. This suggests
                        that it's a prevalent style among beer varieties in your dataset.
                        The next three styles in descending order of popularity are "American Pale Ale (APA)" at 6.77%,
                        "Saison / Farmhouse Ale" at 5.89%, and "American Double / Imperial IPA" at 4.99%.
                        These styles are evidently popular and significantly represented. The smaller slices, such as
                        "Belgian Pale Ale" at 1.88%, indicate less common styles within the dataset
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It's important to note that while a smaller percentage does not necessarily mean a style is
                        unpopular globally, it does reflect its frequency within this specific collection of data.
                        The pie chart effectively highlights the diversity within the beer styles and indicates which
                        styles are most commonly represented in our dataset.
                        This can be useful for understanding consumer preferences, production trends, or for making
                        decisions about what beers to feature if the dataset reflects a particular market or beer
                        selection.

                    <h4>Locations of Users and Breweries</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are 61 countries besides US in the dataset. There are 658 users and 4,323 breweries
                        located outside of the United States.
                        This indicates a significantly higher number of breweries compared to the number of users in
                        these regions.
                        It suggests that while there is a substantial brewing industry outside the US, the user base
                        (who might be rating or using the dataset) is smaller in number.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There are 2,683 users and 3,958 breweries located in the United States. The number of users is
                        considerably higher in the US compared to non-US countries.
                        Additionally, the number of breweries in the US is slightly lower than in non-US countries.
                        This could reflect a higher engagement level with the beer rating or dataset usage among US
                        users,
                        or it could indicate a more significant interest in the diverse range of beer styles available
                        in the US.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The data reflects a robust international brewing industry, yet user engagement with this dataset
                        is more pronounced in the US.
                        This higher activity among American users could explain the predominance of American beer styles
                        in the data.
                        Although the number of breweries is comparable in the US and non-US countries, the user
                        distribution suggests a dataset potentially skewed towards a US-centric audience.

                    <p>Calculating the "distance" between different beer styles based on their textual descriptions
                        involves using text similarity measures that can quantify how close or different the
                        descriptions are.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="analysis">
                    <p>
                        We intend to calculate the similarity between beer styles, which are relatively abstract and not
                        indicative of specific flavors.
                        To address this, we have sourced detailed descriptions of beer characteristics from other
                        websites. These descriptions cover the following aspects:
                        Color, Clarity, Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor, Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor, Perceived
                        Bitterness, Fermentation Characteristics, Body, Alcohol by Volume (ABV),
                        International Bitterness Units (IBU), and Standard Reference Method (SRM) for color.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The selection of these dimensions to describe beer styles is deliberate, as they represent key
                        aspects of a beer's sensory and chemical properties,
                        which typically influence consumer preferences and choices. Among these, Alcohol_ABV,
                        Bitterness_IBU, and Color_SRM are specific numerical ranges,
                        while the others are textual descriptions. For the numarical ranges, we combine its mean value
                        and its ranges to calculate similarities.
                        For the textual parts, we compute similarity using word2vec to quantify the likeness between
                        descriptors.
                        Finally, we combine the numerical values and textual vectors to represent the flavor profile of
                        a beer style.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Table for a subset beer style similarities</h4>
                    <p>In the dataset, there are 104 beer styles. Here we select 5 beer styles to analyze the similarity
                        results</p>
                    <div id="similarity-table" class="plotly-chart"></div>
                    <h4>Analysis for a subset beer style similarities</h4>
                    <p>
                        <b>English Brown Ale and American Brown Ale</b> show the highest similarity (0.99),
                        which is consistent with their close characteristics in terms of color (SRM values are
                        overlapping),
                        alcohol content (ABV), and malt flavor profiles,
                        even though the American Brown Ale tends to have a higher bitterness (IBU) and more varied body.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Smoked Beer</b> is markedly different from the other beer styles, as indicated by its lower
                        similarity scores across the board (e.g., 0.55 with English Brown Ale).
                        This is due to its broad range in every category, particularly the color (1-100 SRM) and
                        bitterness (1-120 IBU), and the fact that the other sensory characteristics are variable.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>American Pale Lager</b> has moderate similarity with the American IPA (0.87) despite having a
                        much lighter color (2-4 SRM compared to 6-12 SRM) and lower bitterness (5-19 IBU compared to
                        50-70 IBU).
                        It shares a similar range of alcohol content with the IPAs, which may account for some of the
                        similarity.
                        <br>

                        <b>American IPA</b> shows high similarity with the American Brown Ale (0.98), likely due to
                        shared hop flavor characteristics and a similar range in alcohol content.
                        However, the American IPA is distinct in its higher bitterness and the specific hop flavors it
                        presents, such as floral, citrus-like, and piney notes, which contribute to its uniqueness.

                        The beer was clustered based on ABV and several detailed ratings to investigate the similarity
                        patterns among different beers.

                        The quantitative features 'ABV', 'Appearance', 'Aroma', 'Palate', and 'Taste' are utilized in
                        this section. To mitigate the impact of ABV data's scale and distribution, it is divided into
                        five intervals and values are reassigned. To better identify different types of beer, we aim to
                        classify beers based on the relative relationships across various features. Therefore, we have
                        chosen to explore this using k-means clustering based on cosine distance.
                        <br>
                        After careful selection of the optimal number of clusters using regression methods and
                        incorporating the clustering results, the beers in our dataset have been divided into five
                        distinct categories. We have analyzed and plotted the cluster centroids to represent the
                        overarching characteristics of all the beers within each cluster. (All ratings have been
                        normalized to a scale ranging from 0 to 1.)

                        From the radar charts, we can intuitively deduce that the alcohol by volume (ABV) level does not
                        significantly impact the overall evaluation of beer, provided other features are well-balanced.
                        Conversely, a beer's appearance and ABV level are not sufficient to compensate for poor taste
                        and aroma. This suggests that while ABV and appearance contribute to a beer's appeal, taste and
                        aroma are critical factors in determining its overall quality and reception. This observation is
                        in line with the results obtained from ridge regression in each cluster.

                    <p>
                        By implementing ridge regression on each cluster, we generate a feature importance map based on
                        the coefficients of features. These maps consistently highlight taste and aroma as the most
                        influential
                        factors in customer preferences across all clusters, while the third most significant
                        feature tends to oscillates between palate and appearance. Meanwhile, attributes like ABV level
                        and
                        appearance remain a relatively minor impact, underscoring that taste, followed by aroma and
                        palate,
                        predominantly shapes customer evaluations of beers.

                        Let's now visualize some examples within each cluster. We select the top five beers with the
                        highest ratings and the bottom five with the lowest ratings in each cluster, and use MDS to
                        project them onto a 2D map. It's noticeable that although the ratings of beers vary widely,
                        their characteristics consistently align with their respective clusters. For instance, red
                        points (beers from the 'High ABV, Visually Pleasing Beer' cluster) all possess relatively high
                        ABV and appearance values, typically accompanied by moderate or lower performance in other
                        aspects. The green points (beers from the 'Mild ABV, Well-Rounded Beer' cluster) uniformly
                        exhibit lower ABV values with well-balanced performance across other features.

                    <p>
					Do beer names like "Tokyo" influence users' focus on oriental spices like coriander? We investigate how a beer's name, with its emotional tone (ranging from descriptive, like 'Co-op Wheat Beer,' to creative, such as 'Pheasantry Dancing Dragonfly') and language, may influence reviews.
					<!-- To identify language, we use the langdetect library based on Google's language-detection library. For sentiment analysis, we employ Hugging Face's transformers library with a pre-trained bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment model. -->
					</p>
                </div>
                <div class="analysis">
                    <p>
					Among beer names, English accounts for the largest proportion, reaching about 30%. we take beer names in English, French, German, Italian, Dutch, and Spanish as the main research objects.
					</p>
                    <div id="language_dis" class="plotly-chart" align="center"></div>
					<h4> The impact of different languages of beer on ratings </h4>
					<p>
					We found that the language of a beer’s name had a significant impact on its rating. Among them, compared with other languages, the distribution of German and Dutch beer names can increase the beer score by 0.04, 0.05, at a 5% confidence level.
					<br>
                    <br>
					Interestingly, the two languages are considered highly similar. We speculate that this may be related to German beer culture and reputation.
					</p>
					<div id="beername1" class="plotly-chart" align="center"></div>
					<h4> The impact of sentiment conveyed by beer on ratings </h4>
					<p>
					We divided the linguistic sentiment of beer names into five levels from 1 to 5. We found that, overall, the sentiment of positive beer names had a significant positive impact on their ratings. Each increase in emotional level can increase the beer rating by 0.01.
					<br>
					<br>
					In subsamples from different users' locations, this positive impact of language emotion is significant for users in the United States and Canada, but not significant in Europe.
					</p>
					<div id="beername2" class="plotly-chart" align="center"></div>
					<p>
					Then, we replaced the explained variable (rating) with beer characteristics: abv, appearance, aroma, palate, and taste. We found that positive beer verbal emotions have a significant positive impact on appearance, aroma, palate, and taste, especially taste. (There is no doubt that abv is objectively unaffected.)
					</p>
					<div id="beername4" class="plotly-chart" align="center"></div>
					<h4> The impact of the sentiment conveyed by beer names in various languages on ratings </h4>					
					<p>
					We divided the linguistic sentiment of beer names into five levels from 1 to 5. We found that, overall, the verbal sentiment of positive beer names had a significant positive impact on their ratings. Each increase in emotional level can increase the beer rating by 0.02.
					<br>
					<br>
					The intersection of linguistic emotion and language shows that this positive effect of linguistic emotion is enhanced in beers named in French and Spanish. In German and Italian, negative effects are shown.
