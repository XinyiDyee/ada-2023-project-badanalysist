                <p>
                    Embark on a journey into the secret world of beer with our project! 
                    Dive deep into the trends and tastes of the beer world as we meticulously interpret vast datasets from BeerAdvocate and RateBeer. 
                    Our exploration uncovers not just the popularity of beer and the influence of naming on ratings, 
                    but also delves into the similarities between styles. Utilizing methods like K-means clustering, 
                    sentiment analysis, and graph network modeling, we analyze over a million beer ratings to comprehensively define beer styles. 
                    From clustering regional preferences to exploring the sentiment and language in beer names, 
                    and studying textual similarities between beer styles, 
                    our project merges statistical methods with natural language processing techniques to offer a multi-faceted view of the beer domain. 
                    Our findings provide guidance for breweries and tailor recommendations for users, 
                    considering not just popularity but also quality attributes and regional taste variations. 
                    Join us on this fascinating journey of beer exploration!

                    <p>
                        Our matched dataset, featuring 6,084 breweries and 45,640 beers from BeerAdvocate and RateBeer, includes over 1.2 million ratings. 
                        A 20-rating threshold refines this extensive dataset, optimizing processing speed and focusing on frequently reviewed beers. 
                        The matched data from both platforms ensures cross-platform consistency, enhancing our model's reliability and quality, 
                        making it ideal for developing a beer recommendation system.

                    <h4>Distribution comparison of rating features between two websites</h4>
                    <p>
                        The histogram charts presented appear to compare the distribution of beer ratings between two websites: RateBeer and BeerAdvocate. 
                        The data has been cleaned to remove all NaN values and then standardized using min-max scaling to ensure comparability across different rating scales. 
                        The histograms are divided into five categories: alcohol by volume (abv), appearance, aroma, palate, and taste.
                        From a visual analysis, we can see that the general trends between RateBeer and BeerAdvocate are similar, 
                        suggesting a level of agreement in the ratings of the matched data provided by users on both platforms.
                        The most notable patterns are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>ABV:</b> The distribution for ABV appears to be left-skewed for both RateBeer and BeerAdvocate, indicating that most beers have a lower alcohol content.</li>
                        <li><b>Appearance:</b> Both sites show a high frequency of beers with higher appearance ratings, with a sharp peak at the high end of the scale.</li>
                        <li><b>Aroma:</b> The distributions for aroma ratings are quite similar between the two sites, with a slight right skew, suggesting that users generally rate the aroma of beers positively.</li>
                        <li><b>Palate:</b> The palate ratings show a more varied distribution, with RateBeer displaying a bimodal distribution, suggesting two common ratings at which beers are evaluated, whereas BeerAdvocate's distribution is more right-skewed.</li>
                        <li><b>Taste:</b> Taste ratings are crucial, and here both sites show a right-skewed distribution, indicating a tendency towards higher ratings for taste.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div id="rate-dist" class="plotly-chart"></div>
                    <div class="spacing"></div>

                    <h4>Beer feature and score correlations of the two websites</h4>
                    <p>For RateBeer:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is a moderate to strong positive correlation between taste and aroma, which is the highest correlation observed (0.74).</li>
                        <li>Appearance has a moderate positive correlation with palate (0.44) and taste (0.40).</li>
                        <li>ABV has the lowest correlations with other features, suggesting that the alcohol content does not strongly influence how users rate the other attributes of the beer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For BeerAdvocate:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The correlations are generally higher compared to RateBeer, indicating a stronger relationship between the features on this platform.</li>
                        <li>Taste and aroma again have a strong positive correlation (0.76), which is consistent with RateBeer's ratings.</li>
                        <li>Appearance has a strong correlation with both palate (0.56) and taste (0.52), which is somewhat stronger than on RateBeer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Overall, this heatmap suggests that certain attributes of beer, such as taste and aroma, 
                        are consistently perceived as related by users of both RateBeer and BeerAdvocate. 
                        The strength of the correlations varies slightly between the two platforms, but the general pattern remains the same, 
                        indicating similar rating behaviors among the users. 
                        This information can be particularly useful for brewers and marketers to understand what characteristics of beer are 
                        most influential in consumer ratings and perception.
