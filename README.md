# Title
## Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

## Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
  
## Data (Xinyi)
- Why do we select these data?
- Data processing
- Data description (That you understand what's in the data (formats, distributions, missing values, correlations, etc.)

## Project plans
### Task 1: Clustering for Popularity and User Preference (Siyuan)
-	What we will do. (the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?)
- Methods （That you have a reasonable plan and ideas for methods you’re going to use, giving their essential mathematical details in the notebook.）
- Data relevance (Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples)
- Feasibility （That your plan for analysis and communication is reasonable and sound, potentially discussing alternatives to your choices that you considered but dropped.）

### Task 2: Beer Name Reflect Beer Flavor (Zhixun)
- Does the beer's name "Tokyo" make users pay more attention to the aroma of oriental spices (such as coriander)? We are intrigued by the possibility that the emotional tone and language conveyed by a beer's name might affect not only the rating but also the content and sentiments within the rating text.

- Methods （That you have a reasonable plan and ideas for methods you’re going to use, giving their essential mathematical details in the notebook.）
- Data relevance (Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples)
$$Rating_{i,j} = \beta_1 \times sentiments \quad within \quad name_i + \beta_2 \times X_j + \beta_3 \times Y_i +\epsilon_{i,j}$$
- Feasibility （That your plan for analysis and communication is reasonable and sound, potentially discussing alternatives to your choices that you considered but dropped.）

### Task 3: Recommendation Function (Yihan)
- What we will do. (the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?)
- Methods （That you have a reasonable plan and ideas for methods you’re going to use, giving their essential mathematical details in the notebook.）
- Data relevance (Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples)
- Feasibility （That your plan for analysis and communication is reasonable and sound, potentially discussing alternatives to your choices that you considered but dropped.）
